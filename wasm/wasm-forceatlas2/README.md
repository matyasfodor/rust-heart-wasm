<h1><code>Wasm forceatlas 2</code></h1>

Based on the Rust forceatlas implementation ([forceatlas2](https://crates.io/crates/forceatlas2)), this is a binding between js and the Rust implementation. The long term plan is to create a faithful implementation of the [Graphology - forceatlas2](https://graphology.github.io/standard-library/layout-forceatlas2.html) npm library to serve as a drop-in replacement of the pure JavaScript implementation with a better performance.
